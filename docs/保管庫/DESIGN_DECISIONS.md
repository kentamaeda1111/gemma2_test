# Design Decisions for Japanese-Speaking Socratic Gemma

## Document Purpose

This document outlines the key design decisions and rationale behind the Japanese-Speaking Socratic Gemma project, a Kaggle competition submission that fine-tunes Gemma-2b for Socratic-style dialogue generation in Japanese. While the technical implementation details can be found in the code, this document focuses on the philosophical and empirical foundations that guided our approach.

## Fundamental Premise: The Primacy of Data Quality

Our core thesis, supported by recent research, is that the quality of training data is more crucial than model architecture or hyperparameter tuning for achieving desired language model behavior. This "data-centric" approach is particularly relevant when attempting to instill specific conversational styles or patterns in smaller language models.

Two recent studies particularly influenced this perspective:

1. Liu et al. (2023) demonstrated that parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA can effectively capture individual writing styles, but the success heavily depends on the quality and consistency of the training data. Their work showed that even with limited parameters, models could learn distinct stylistic features when trained on carefully curated datasets.

2. Li et al. (2023) introduced SCAR (Style Consistency-Aware Response Ranking), highlighting how style consistency in training data significantly impacts model performance. Their research revealed that models trained on smaller, style-consistent datasets often outperformed those trained on larger, inconsistent datasets.

These findings are particularly relevant to our project because:

- We're working with a relatively small model (Gemma-2b)
- We're targeting a specific stylistic goal (Socratic dialogue patterns)
- We're operating under computational constraints

This data-centric philosophy informed all subsequent design decisions, from dataset size and composition to evaluation metrics and hyperparameter optimization. While we acknowledge that the "questioning power" of Socrates represents a deep cognitive skill beyond our current scope, we believe that consistent stylistic patterns can be effectively learned through high-quality, well-structured training data.

The following sections detail how this fundamental premise influenced specific aspects of our implementation...
