Traditional training methods involve stochastic gradient descent on large datasets, leading to models that fit the training data well but struggle with effective generalization and are prone to errors.
Foundation models often follow the Chinchilla recipe, training for a single epoch on extensive datasets like training Llama 2 7B on approximately one trillion tokens. This can enhance generalization and creativity but lacks precision for tasks requiring high factual accuracy.
Lamini Memory Tuning goes beyond traditional methods by analyzing the loss of individual facts, significantly enhancing factual recall accuracy.
This approach involves adding extra parameters dedicated to memory in the model (e.g., augmenting an 8B parameter model with 2B additional parameters for weights). This augmentation allows the model to memorize and accurately recall a large number of facts, improving performance alignment with LLM scaling laws while maintaining generalization capabilities.

Design: Lamini-1 model architecture utilizes a pre-trained transformer backbone with dynamically selected adapters from an index using cross-attention mechanisms.
Functionality: Adapters in Lamini-1 operate akin to experts in MoE architectures, facilitating end-to-end training while keeping the backbone frozen. This mechanism ensures that specific facts are accurately stored in the chosen experts.
Inference Optimization: During inference, only the pertinent experts are retrieved from the index, enabling the system to retain a vast amount of information while simultaneously ensuring low latency during inference.
Performance Enhancement: The system leverages specialised GPU kernels implemented in Triton to expedite the expert lookup process, thus optimizing the architecture for rapid access to stored knowledge.
Systems Optimisations for Banishing Hallucinations
The MoME architecture focuses on minimizing computational demand for memorizing facts through specific optimizations:

Expert Selection: During training, only a subset of experts (e.g., 32 out of a million) is chosen for each fact.
Weight Freezing: The backbone network and cross-attention weights for expert selection are frozen, with gradient descent iterations performed until the loss is adequately reduced to memorize the fact.
Preventing Expert Reuse: To avoid the same expert being selected for different facts, a cross-attention selection mechanism is first trained during a generalization phase and then the weights are frozen.
Scalable Computation: By ensuring that computation scales with the number of training examples and not the total parameters, the method significantly reduces the computational load for memory tuning.
Efficiency and Efficacy: This optimized approach allows Lamini-1 to achieve nearly zero loss in memory tuning for real and random answers, efficiently eliminating hallucinations while enhancing factual recall.
Mixture of Experts
A Mixture of Experts (MoE) in neural networks involves dividing the computations of a layer into specialized subnetworks called "experts":

Each expert independently performs its computation task.
The individual expert outputs are combined to generate the final layer output.
MoE architectures can be dense, where all experts are involved for each input, or sparse, where only a subset of experts is used for each input.
Mixtral 8x7B Architecture and Performance
The Mixtral 8x7B model utilizes a Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) architecture, similar to Mistral 7B but with eight feedforward blocks (experts) per layer. Key points include:

MoA employs multiple complete LLMs across various layers instead of specialised subnetworks in a single model.
Gating and expert network functions are combined within an LLM in MoA, utilizing its prompt interpretation capabilities to generate coherent outputs seamlessly.
What Makes MoA Work Well?
MoA's effectiveness stems from several key factors:

Superior Performance: MoA surpasses LLM-based rankers by a large margin. While LLM-based rankers pick one answer from existing options, MoA aggregates all generated responses. This strategy proves more potent in delivering results, indicating that the process of combining multiple responses is more effective than selecting from a set of predefined choices.
Effective Incorporation of Proposals
The aggregator in the MoA system effectively integrates the best proposed answers, as indicated by positive correlations with similarity metrics like BLEU scores, which assess n-gram overlaps. Furthermore:

Other similarity measures besides BLEU also exhibit a positive correlation with preference scores, signifying the aggregator's adeptness in utilizing proposed responses.
The consistent positive correlation between alternative similarity measures and preference scores reinforces the effectiveness of the aggregator in incorporating proposed responses.
Influence of Model Diversity and Proposer Count
Increasing the number of proposers enhances output quality by leveraging extra auxiliary information. Moreover, employing a variety of LLMs as proposers consistently leads to superior outcomes compared to using a single LLM model. It indicates that the abundance and diversity of LLM agents in each MoA layer play a role in boosting performance, with possibilities for even better results by scaling up.

More proposers enhance output quality by utilizing additional information.
