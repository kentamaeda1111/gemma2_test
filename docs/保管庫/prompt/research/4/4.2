Introduction
The domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has evolved significantly with the emergence of Transformer-based Language Models (TLMs) like GPT-3, which have billions of parameters and excel in various tasks beyond traditional NLP. However, these models face challenges due to their resource-intensive nature, prompting the exploration of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like adapter training.

Adapter training involves adding domain-specific parameters (adapters) to pretrained models, updating only the adapter parameters during training.
While adapters offer simplicity, they may not capture complex patterns effectively, and determining optimal adapter locations can be tricky.
Prompt tuning, a method providing contextual information without modifying the model structure, complements adapter training.
Prefix tuning, which consistently updates sections of all layers, has shown improved task performance.
SK-Tuning is proposed as a new approach to enhance fine-tuning of LLMs for prompt and prefix tuning by using genuine, semantically rich prompts or prefixes.

SK-Tuning leverages the model's understanding of linguistic semantics and zero-shot capabilities for quicker convergence during fine-tuning.
The method involves freezing the pretrained model, extracting semantic representations from prompts/prefixes, training small adapters, and integrating revised representations with input embeddings.
Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of SK-Tuning in tasks like sequence and token classification, highlighting its superiority over traditional methods.
Major contributions of the paper include the introduction of SK-Tuning, improving training efficiency using real prompts/prefixes, and reducing computational requirements compared to standard fine-tuning approaches.

Background Study
Prefix and prompt tuning are adaptive techniques used with large pretrained language models to tailor them for specific tasks or datasets without extensively modifying the model parameters. These methods have become popular for their efficiency and effectiveness, especially in situations where retraining the entire model is challenging due to computational constraints.

The adaptation of pretrained language models:
Prefix and prompt tuning: Methods for customizing large pretrained language models.
Objective: Tailor models to specific tasks or datasets with minimal parameter adjustments.
Advantages: Efficient and effective, particularly when full model updates are not feasible.
Significance:
Efficiency: Enables model adaptation without computationally expensive retraining.
Effectiveness: Allows optimization for specific tasks or datasets with minimal changes.
Prefix Tuning
Prefix tuning is a technique where a sequence of tunable vectors, called the prefix, is appended to the input of each layer in a transformer model. This modification alters the mapping function of the transformer model from y = F(x) to y = F(p ⊕ x), where p is the prefix vector and ⊕ denotes concatenation. Specifically, for a transformer model with K layers where each layer k performs a transformation F l , the modified transformation incorporating the prefix is formulated as follows:

The prefix tuning involves modifying the mapping function of the transformer model by appending a learnable prefix to the input of each layer.
The prefix is concatenated with the input sequence before being processed by each layer in the transformer model.
The prefixes {p 1 , p 2 , ..., p K } are adjustable parameters that are optimized during the training phase.
Prompt Tuning
Prompt tuning involves utilizing natural language prompts to guide a model in generating task-specific outputs. This method does not alter the model's internal mechanisms but influences its outputs by providing tailored input sequences. Specifically:

It aims to find an optimal prompt for a pretrained model M to enhance its performance on a task T.
The objective is to maximize the likelihood of correct outputs y_i for inputs x_i concatenated with the optimal prompt p*.
Unlike prefix tuning, prompt tuning focuses on adjusting input sequences rather than modifying the model's internal structure.
Problem Definition
The problem entails fine-tuning a pretrained Large Language Model (LLM) denoted as M for downstream tasks while keeping the model parameters Θ fixed. The objective is to introduce adapters or transformations, a small set of additional parameters, for task-specific adaptation without retraining the entire LLM. Each task configuration in the system is represented by an instance (x_i, y_i) where x_i is the input text and y_i is the true label. The goal is to find trainable parameters Φ for the adapters or transformations to fine-tune the LLM, denoted as -M(Θ,Φ), with Θ frozen, by minimizing a task-specific loss function L that measures model predictions' alignment with true labels in the dataset D.

Training dataset D = {(x_i, y_i)}_N_i=1 consists of input texts x_i and true labels y_i.
Fine-tuning aims to introduce adapters (Φ) to adapt the pretrained LLM (M) to specific downstream tasks.
The objective is to effectively train a small number of parameters (Φ) while preserving the core architecture and parameters (Θ) of the pretrained model.
The approach seeks to achieve parameter efficiency by customizing the LLM for specific downstream tasks.
SK-Tuning for Prefix
SK-Tuning for Prefix aims to enhance the performance of a pretrained Language Model (LLM) in downstream tasks by integrating semantic knowledge from prefixes into the fine-tuning process. Here are the key points from this section:

The traditional approach involves using a mapping function to generate trainable parameters for the LLM's layer representation during prefix-tuning. However, the SK-Tuning approach adopts a different strategy.
In SK-Tuning, semantic knowledge embeddings from prefix tokens are directly acquired from a pretrained LLM with frozen parameters, rather than using virtual trainable tokens.
The objective is to extract semantic hidden representations from each layer of the LLM for a given input prefix comprising semantic knowledge tokens.
A trainable adapter, parameterized by Φ, is introduced to produce a semantic projection z from the hidden representation of the prefix tokens for each layer of the LLM.
Concatenating z with the processing layer allows access to semantic information from the prefix text, improving task-specific adaptation for each layer during input processing.
A task-specific module C, parameterized by ζ, computes the output o i for downstream tasks.
The algorithm for SK-Tuning for Prefix involves initializing trainable parameters, processing input examples through the frozen LLM to obtain hidden representations, transforming representations with a trainable adapter, and updating parameters iteratively to minimize loss during fine-tuning.
The algorithm iterates through each input example, obtaining layer embeddings for the prefix text and updating parameters to minimize loss for improved task performance.
Training Objective and Parameter Adjustment
The training objective of the model is to minimize the loss function L, which measures the difference between the predicted output o_i and the actual label y_i for each input x_i. This minimization process evaluates how well the model represents the correct labels for the given inputs.

Key points:

Objective: Minimize the loss function L to reduce the error in predicting labels for input data.
Focus: Emphasizes improving the model's ability to understand and represent labels accurately.
Benefit: Allows the model to leverage the inherent knowledge within the parameters Θ for better performance.
Parameter Adjustment: Fine-tuning parameters Φ and ζ enhances the model's capability to effectively map textual inputs to their corresponding labels.
Purpose: Facilitates refining the model's representation and understanding of labels during the training process.
SK-Tuning for Prompt
SK-Tuning for prompts involves integrating semantic knowledge into a pretrained LLM through trainable adapters and specific training objectives. This method enhances the model's performance across various downstream tasks by leveraging semantic information from prompts effectively. The process includes:

Forming semantic embeddings for prompt tokens and input text in a pretrained language model (LLM).
Utilizing a trainable adapter to refine the semantic knowledge captured in prompts without altering the frozen model parameters.

Results consistently demonstrated the robustness and versatility of SK-Tuning across various LLM architectures, highlighting its broad applicability and effectiveness across different model sizes and complexities.
Limitations
SK-Tuning, despite its advantages in performance and parameter efficiency, has important limitations to consider:

Limited scope of applicability: SK-Tuning may not be suitable for all types of models or datasets.

Complexity handling: Managing complex or highly non-linear models with SK-Tuning may pose challenges.

Manual intervention: The process might require manual adjustments or expert knowledge, limiting its automation.

Interpretability concerns: Tuned models may become harder to interpret due to the optimization process.

These limitations highlight important considerations when using SK-Tuning despite its benefits.

Training and Inference Time Overhead
SK-Tuning may experience a drawback in terms of increased training and inference times due to its use of the pre-trained Language Model (LLM) twice in the forward pass. The process involves utilizing the LLM initially for extracting semantic details from the prompt or prefix and then again for handling the input data to generate the output. This dual utilization of the LLM can result in prolonged training and inference durations.

The primary concern with SK-Tuning is the potential rise in training and inference times.
In SK-Tuning, the pre-trained LLM is used twice during the forward pass, leading to increased computational overhead.
The first LLM usage is to extract semantic information from the prompt or prefix.
The second LLM usage is for processing the input data to produce the final output.
This repeated reliance on the LLM contributes to longer training and inference times, impacting efficiency.
Dependency on Pretrained Models
The effectiveness of SK-Tuning is closely tied to the quality and capabilities of the underlying pretrained Large Language Model (LLM). Here are key points from this section:

SK-Tuning heavily depends on the zero-shot capabilities of the pretrained LLM.
The success of prompt or prefix text tuning is directly affected by how well the pretrained model comprehends semantic knowledge and linguistic skills.
If the pretrained model lacks robust semantic understanding or certain linguistic competencies, it can diminish the effectiveness of SK-Tuning.
Significant training is necessary for the pretrained model to accurately grasp the semantic meaning conveyed in the prompt or prefix text.
Semantic Knowledge Acquisition
In SK-Tuning, the performance is heavily influenced by the relevance of prompts or prefixes used, as detailed in Section 6.4. The more pertinent the prompt is to the task, the higher the performance achieved. However, finding or generating these relevant prompts can be challenging, often necessitating domain-specific expertise.

Key points:

The effectiveness of SK-Tuning is linked to the meaningfulness of prompts or prefixes employed.
Higher task performance is associated with prompts that closely align with the task requirements.
Difficulty in creating or identifying relevant prompts may hinder the utility of SK-Tuning for certain tasks or datasets.
Tuning Hyperparameters
SK-Tuning, similar to other fine-tuning methods, requires tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance. This tuning involves several key aspects:

Designing the adapter architecture
Selecting the appropriate semantic knowledge text
Adjusting task-specific modules
Tuning hyperparameters is crucial for improving the effectiveness of SK-Tuning, but this process can be demanding in terms of time and computational resources.
