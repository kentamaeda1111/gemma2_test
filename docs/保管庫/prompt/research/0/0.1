Haocheng Lin


Overview of Large Language Models and Their Growing Application Across Industries
Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and BERT have significantly advanced natural language processing by conducting various tasks, including text generation, language translation, document summarization, and context understanding for engaging conversations.

Trained on extensive datasets like the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), LLMs rely on billions of parameters to carry out domain-specific functions in industries like healthcare, finance, legal services, and education.

GPT-4, a transformer-based multimodal model, has found applications in diverse areas such as image processing, dialogue systems, and machine translation, expanding its capabilities beyond text-based tasks.

Comparing GPT-4 to its predecessor, GPT-3, which had 175 billion parameters, helps assess the evolution of GPT models in managing generalized tasks with reduced supervision.

While LLMs exhibit versatility, they encounter challenges when applied in specialized domains like public policy and environmental governance, necessitating deeper analysis and context understanding for predicting nuanced socio-political opinions and integrating socio-demographic and policy-specific factors effectively in generating realistic synthetic profiles.

Limitations of General-Purpose LLMs in Domain-Specific Tasks
General-purpose large language models (LLMs) face limitations when applied to domain-specific tasks due to their pre-training on broad public-domain datasets. These limitations include:

Challenges in Specialized Tasks:

LLMs struggle to excel in specialized tasks like analyzing various opinions on environmental policies, as they may not capture how socio-demographic factors influence individual responses to such issues.
Inaccuracies in Predictions:

Research indicates that LLMs can overestimate concerns about climate change, leading to misaligned policies that deepen socio-political divisions.
Biases Amplification:

Pre-trained models risk amplifying biases present in their training data, potentially resulting in skewed or inaccurate predictions. For example, the COMPAS algorithm was criticized for reinforcing biases against marginalized groups.
Risk of Perpetuating Biases:

Like COMPAS, LLMs can perpetuate biases if the training data is biased. Without specialized fine-tuning and prompt engineering, LLMs may reflect or magnify these biases in generated text.
Mitigating Biases:

Techniques like adversarial de-biasing and fairness constraints play a crucial role in mitigating biases and ensuring accurate, representative outputs when using LLMs in real-world applications.
Fine-Tuning as a Solution for Domain-Specific Adaptation
Fine-tuning is highlighted as a robust method to address the constraints of general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) by customizing pretrained models to specific domains, such as the UKHLS dataset, which covers various socio-demographic aspects. The process involves adapting models to generate responses that resonate with current attitudes on real-world issues, particularly by focusing on demographic variables like age, income, education, and region.

Key points included:

Fine-tuning improves the contextual relevance of pre-trained models by iteratively adjusting them to consider socio-demographic factors, thereby enhancing the generation of responses that capture diverse perspectives rather than just mainstream opinions.
This adaptation strategy is not only cost-effective but also aids in gathering valuable insights to refine environmental policies.
The fine-tuning process not only makes LLMs more adaptable but also boosts their scalability, offering an efficient alternative to conventional models.
Objectives
This paper delves into the impact of fine-tuning on Large Language Models (LLMs) when applied to domain-specific tasks, focusing on simulating opinions regarding environmental policies. The main objective is to enhance the performance of LLMs by leveraging the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) dataset for conditioning and fine-tuning to advance the accuracy of predicting opinions compared to real-world data. The specific objectives include:

Investigating how fine-tuning can boost LLMs' performance in domain-specific tasks
Using the UKHLS dataset for conditioning and fine-tuning LLMs

LLM Architecture: Development of Transformer-Based Models
Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and BERT employ a transformer architecture that differs from traditional models like RNNs or LSTMs by utilizing self-attention mechanisms for parallel processing:

Transformers excel in handling large datasets efficiently and capturing long-range dependencies.
They overcome issues like vanishing gradients, ensuring effective learning from long sequences.
In transformer-based models, two key components shape their architecture: self-attention layers and feedforward networks:

Self-attention evaluates token significance across the entire sequence simultaneously, enabling effective relationship and context capture.
This feature enhances the models' ability to process and understand nuanced content by focusing on relevant words throughout the text.
Transformers employ attention weights calculated using query, key, and value vectors to quantify input sequence focus:

Multiple attention heads in the layers focus on distinct aspects like syntactical or semantic connections.
The multi-head structure allows processing language from varied abstraction levels simultaneously.
By utilizing multihead attention mechanisms and layered structures, transformers enhance their ability to grasp different abstraction levels and interpret overall context behind output distributions:

These structures empower transformers to comprehend diverse relationships and process information from complex datasets effectively.
BERT and GPT showcase the capabilities of transformer models in language tasks:

BERT's bidirectional training boosts contextual understanding, while GPT uses probability sequences for word prediction, expanding its ability to generate synthetic opinions on topics like environmental issues.
Transformer models demonstrate scalability and flexibility, enabling them to handle specialized tasks effectively.

Fine-tuning Overview
Fine-tuning is a process where pre-trained Large Language Models are adapted to work effectively in specific domains by retraining them on smaller, domain-specific datasets. This adjustment helps the model's outputs match the expected distributions of the target domain. Key points included:

Purpose: To enhance model performance in specialized domains.
Adjustments: Include modifications to parameters like weights, learning rate, batch size, and epochs for improved performance.
Strategy: A successful fine-tuning strategy ensures that these parameters are tuned effectively to achieve optimal outcomes.
Efficient Fine-tuning with Adapters and LoRA
Recent advancements like Adapters and LoRA (Low-Rank Algorithm) have improved fine-tuning by focusing on small subsets of training data, enhancing model efficiency. Adapters, for instance, are lightweight modules placed between transformer layers and retrained for specific tasks, allowing models to adjust to task-specific needs while maintaining general capabilities.

Key points:

Adapters, as modular components, facilitate flexible adjustments to reflect socio-demographic profiles like younger or lower-income groups.
LoRA integrates low-rank matrices into transformer layers, reducing training parameters effectively. This cost-effective method is ideal for fine-tuning smaller, domain-specific subsets without compromising performance.
While adapters introduce some latency and LoRA's low-rank approximations may struggle with complex tasks, combining both techniques can enhance flexibility in Language Model Models (LLMs).
By combining the modular structure of adapters with LoRA, researchers achieve a balance between general knowledge retention and task-specific accuracy, resulting in LLMs with improved flexibility.

Task-specific Fine-tuning and Prompt Engineering
Task-specific fine-tuning involves adjusting the internal parameters of Large Language Models (LLMs) to align with specific task requirements, while prompt engineering focuses on crafting instructions to guide LLMs without changing their structure. The designed prompts are categorized as system prompts, defining the LLMs' persona for understanding operational context, and user prompts, specifying instructions for executing tasks with relevant context and expected output descriptions.

System prompts: Define the persona for LLMs to understand operational context.
User prompts: Specify task instructions containing relevant context and expected output descriptions.
This approach benefits few-shot or zero-shot learning scenarios, enabling models to generalize from limited examples and adapt to new tasks with minimal labeled data. Carefully designed prompts help LLMs tailor their outputs to meet task-specific requirements, improving performance in sentiment analysis, classification, and decision-making. While fine-tuning adjusts models' parameters based on training data, prompt engineering provides interpretable instructions to guide models in producing desired outputs, optimizing performance.

The T5base prompt-learning paradigm optimizes prompts to ensure LLMs achieve at least 75% accuracy compared to a fully fine-tuned LLM model.
Integrating Socio-Demographic Factors
The integration of socio-demographic factors in the UK Household Longitudinal Study Datasets improves the performance of Latent Linear Models (LLMs) in analyzing public attitudes towards environmental policies such as climate change, renewable energy, and sustainability plans.

Key points:

Conditioning LLMs with socio-demographic factors enhances the accuracy of predictions and enables the models to consider the broader context.
Profiling variables in the models help align their responses with real-world scenarios, offering insights into the factors influencing public perceptions of environmental policies.
Understanding these perceptions can assist policymakers in creating more inclusive and transparent environmental strategies that not only address challenges effectively but also garner sufficient public support for legislative approval.
Addressing Biases in LLM Outputs
Addressing biases in Language Model outputs involves ethical challenges, particularly in fine-tuning models like GPT-3 and BERT that can inherit biases from their training data. Here's a summary of the strategies discussed in this section:

Biases from Training Data: Large-scale training datasets introduce biases related to gender, race, or socio-economic status, which can skew the responses of Language Models.
Correcting Biases: Techniques like oversampling specific demographics can help correct biases in outputs, identified through demographic parity tests.
Preprocessing for Bias Mitigation: Methods like normalization and sampling, as demonstrated in the UK Household Longitudinal Study, are used to ensure national-scale representation.
Impact of Fine-Tuning Data: Using non-representative data in fine-tuning can reinforce existing biases, leading to significant real-world implications, particularly in domains like public policy.
Adversarial Debiasing: Integrating adversarial debiasing during fine-tuning helps identify bias patterns and ensure inclusivity. A secondary model detects and addresses sensitive attributes that influence predictions, reducing vulnerabilities associated with such variables.
Challenges of Adversarial Debiasing: While effective, adversarial debiasing may suppress regional variations, necessitating future research into adaptive debiasing methods to balance fairness and demographic representation.
Impact of Echo Chambers
The impact of echo chambers in public opinion simulations is significant, as it influences the representation of diverse demographic groups and the formulation of policies that may favor certain segments of society over others. The following points summarize the key aspects discussed in this section:

Research highlights that lower socio-economic groups are often underrepresented in opinion-based studies due to various factors like digital disparities, time constraints, research distrust, and cultural barriers.
These underrepresented groups pose a risk of policies being skewed towards wealthier demographics, exacerbating existing inequalities in society.
Echo chambers in public discourse lead to the amplification of extreme viewpoints, distorting simulation data, and resulting in models that do not fully represent the spectrum of public sentiment.
Social media platforms play a crucial role in reinforcing echo chambers by displaying content that aligns with users' existing beliefs and preferences, thereby limiting exposure to diverse viewpoints.
Studies from Ireland and the UK demonstrate how echo chambers can bias discussions on topics like climate change and news consumption, revealing that a significant portion of the population remains isolated within their narrow media bubbles.
The presence of distinct groups in news consumption behaviors, with a notable percentage being exposed to limited sources, underscores the risk of generating policies that do not cater to the diverse needs of the population.
Overall, the influence of echo chambers on public opinion simulations and policy-making processes underscores the importance of addressing biases and ensuring a more comprehensive representation of diverse perspectives to create policies that truly serve all segments of society.

Mitigating Polarization with Diversity-Enhancing Algorithms
When conducting surveys on political preferences, a small percentage of online users self-identify as being part of left- or right-wing echo chambers, indicating biases introduced by users desensitized to ideologically aligned content.

Only 2% to 5% of online users identify themselves as members of echo chambers.
Biases are often introduced by users desensitized to ideologically aligned content.
The echo chamber effect leads individuals with specific attitudes, like being pro-environment, to participate more in related studies, causing overrepresentation biases in language models that prefer certain policies.

Pro-environmental individuals are more likely to engage in environmental studies.
Overrepresentation biases are favored by pre-trained language models supporting pro-environmental policies.
Diversity-enhancing algorithms, such as cluster-based sampling, help mitigate biases by incentivizing language models to produce outputs that mirror public opinion.

Diversity-enhancing algorithms like cluster-based sampling correct biases.
These algorithms encourage language models to reflect public opinion in their outputs.
By using diversity-enhancing algorithms like cluster-based sampling, imbalances in datasets, like underrepresentation of rural populations in the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), are corrected through additional samples.

Cluster-based sampling corrects underrepresentation by including supplementary samples.
It ensures that datasets represent various demographics more accurately.
Ultimately, diversity-enhancing algorithms ensure that policy simulations are inclusive and actionable, facilitating fair decision-making that considers the diverse perspectives within communities.

Diversity-enhancing algorithms support equitable decision-making.
They promote inclusivity and support diverse community viewpoints in policy simulations.
Preprocessing Framework for Data Processing
The preprocessing framework for data processing aims to correct biases during fine-tuning by following a set of careful steps:

Data Cleaning:

Removes irrelevant content like invalid values, linguistic errors, and random characters.
Imputes missing values in the UKHLS dataset and discards random or corrupted entries.
Normalization:

Standardizes text format for better comparison between synthetic and real-world profiles.
Example: education categories are simplified into broader groups like "no formal education" and "post-secondary education".

Model parameters are adjusted during fine-tuning based on the importance of selected features to improve model performance.
Early stopping is implemented to prevent overfitting, while dropout layers are included to decrease reliance on specific features.
A regularization term with a weight decay of 0.01 is applied to regularize the model during training.
Fine-tuning, following transfer learning principles, helps the model maintain general knowledge while enabling specialization in understanding socio-demographic distinctions.
Multi-Objective Optimisation Framework
In a multi-objective optimization framework, the loss function incorporates three key components: performance, fairness, and bias reduction losses, represented by a weighted combination in Equation 1.

Performance Loss:

Ensures model accuracy in task-specific scenarios by comparing predicted and expected distributions.
Traditional supervised learning methods, like cross-entropy and mean-squared losses, aid in capturing precise responses:
Cross-entropy loss: Measures disparities between expected and predicted responses for categorical variables.
Mean-squared error: Quantifies average differences on a continuous scale to ensure models mimic expected distributions.
Fairness Loss:

Evaluates differences in model outputs across socio-demographic groups to enhance generalization.
Metrics like demographic parity difference (DPD) and equal opportunity difference (EOD) are used:
DPD: Compares positive outcome rates across groups to identify disparities.
EOD: Determines if stakeholder groups have equal opportunities for positive outcomes.
Bias Reduction Loss:

Addresses biases through adversarial debiasing to enhance representation of underrepresented groups.
Profiles the probability of selecting an attribute as a profiling variable within synthetic profiles.
Integration and Tuning:

The hyperparameters α, β, and γ in Equation 1 regulate the trade-offs between components.
The loss function dynamically combines these components for a balanced optimization, ensuring performance, fairness, and bias considerations are harmonized.
Adversarial Debiasing
Adversarial debiasing in machine learning involves training models to avoid producing biased outcomes based on sensitive attributes like age or income. By incorporating these attributes into the training process, the models are encouraged not to discriminate against protected features. This technique aims to reduce bias in the model's predictions by penalizing the generation of discriminatory results towards sensitive attributes.

Loss Function Example:
One way to implement adversarial debiasing is through a specific loss function represented as the negative logarithm of the predicted probability of the sensitive attribute.
Formula: LBias Reduction = −log(p( ̂sensitive))
By integrating adversarial debiasing into the training of machine learning models, researchers aim to create fairer and more unbiased predictive systems that do not perpetuate discrimination based on sensitive attributes.

Illustration of Fine-tuning Optimisations
The section describes the steps involved in implementing fine-tuning, focusing on pre-training as a crucial phase in the process:

Pre-training: This initial step involves capturing general domain-specific linguistic knowledge from the training data.
Fine-tuning
The researchers propose two key strategies for fine-tuning Language Models (LLMs) to enhance performance and fairness:

Applying weighted loss functions to steer LLMs towards achieving a balance between performance and fairness.
Unfreezing lower layers gradually to improve the representation of the stakeholder population in a step-by-step manner.
Validation
The validation process in this study involves testing the synthetic responses against real-world distributions using various evaluation metrics. Key points included:

Evaluation metrics utilized:
Chi-Square
Cosine Similarity
Fairness metrics such as DPD (Demographic Parity Difference) and EOD (Equal Opportunity Difference)
These metrics are employed to assess how well the synthetic responses align with the actual distributions, providing insights into the effectiveness and accuracy of the generated responses.

Universal Language Model Fine-tuning Case Study
The Universal Language Model Fine-tuning (ULMFiT) method exemplifies addressing overfitting on smaller datasets and establishing robust learning structures for NLP tasks:

Architecture:

ULMFiT involves three layers of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to emphasize retaining conditioning knowledge, showing superior performance in text classification compared to existing models.
Training Process:

The process begins with pre-training a language model on a general-domain corpus to capture linguistic features.
Pre-training imparts foundational knowledge essential for generalizing across diverse domains.
Fine-tuning:

Subsequent fine-tuning involves optimizing the model using discriminative learning rates and slanted triangular learning algorithms on a domain-specific dataset.
These techniques enable gradual adaptation to task-specific features while preserving essential knowledge from the pre-trained state.
Model Adaptation:

An unfreezing operation adjusts both lower and upper layers of the model to maintain lower-level feature robustness.
Comparative Performance:

ULMFiT outperforms other pre-training methods in NLP tasks, particularly beneficial for LSTM-based models.
Transformer-based models like GPT or BERT use alternative fine-tuning techniques such as Adapters or Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
Hybrid Approach:

The methodology integrates LoRA with sparse attention mechanisms during fine-tuning, supported by a dynamic parameter freezing strategy to update relevant parameters effectively.
Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering involves crafting inputs to guide large language models (LLMs) for generating realistic and context-sensitive responses. There are two main types of prompts:

System Prompts:
Establish the LLM's role and context by providing a detailed profile based on sociodemographic variables from the UKHLS datasets.
Example: Specifying an individual's age, income, and attitudes towards environmental issues.
User Prompts:
Specify the task or question for the LLM to address, aiding in generating accurate and relevant predictions.
Example: Asking if an individual is willing to pay more for environmentally friendly products.
Both types of prompts can be customized for different demographics:

Younger individuals may be asked about participation in environmental organizations.
Older groups may be prompted about their willingness to adopt green technology.
Customizing prompts enables LLMs to simulate varied public sentiments. However, it is essential to note that understanding public opinion involves interacting factors that prompts may oversimplify.

Evaluation Metrics
The evaluation metrics in this study focus on assessing the effectiveness of fine-tuning in guiding models to generate accurate public opinions. Key points included:

Various metrics are used to measure the performance of the fine-tuned models.
These metrics help in understanding the impact of fine-tuning on the accuracy of public opinions generated by the models.
The evaluation process involves comparing the fine-tuned models' outputs with ground truth data or expert opinions to gauge their accuracy.
Metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy are likely used to evaluate the models' performance.
Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL Divergence)
Chi-Square tests play a crucial role in evaluating whether synthetic distributions match the expected distributions from the UKHLS dataset, helping identify over- or under-representation within specific groups. These tests, as outlined in Eq. 3, contribute to assessing how well the LLMs can learn the connection between demographic variables and public perceptions of environmental policies.

Key points included:

Chi-Square tests are essential for objective 3, ensuring that the output distributions of finely tuned models accurately mirror the sociodemographic diversity found in real-world data. This alignment is critical for realistically simulating public opinions on environmental policies.
Cosine similarity, expressed by vectors ranging from -1 (dissimilar) to +1 (similar) in Eq. 4, measures the likeness between synthetic and expected distributions.
Cosine similarity aids objectives 3 and 4, pinpointing limitations in capturing similarities between categorical responses and showcasing the extent of disparities between synthetic and expected responses.
Unlike alternative metrics, cosine similarity is a robust measure that is unaffected by response scale variations when comparing distributions, enabling the accommodation of minority or contentious viewpoints. Normalized values of cosine similarity gauge the direction of opinion deviations without distortion by magnitude.
Regarding questions with categorical responses, especially those with a binary response set, the Jaccard Index is valuable for quantifying similarities and determining the presence or absence of a characteristic within synthetic responses.
Through converting responses into a binary format, the Jaccard Index computes the overlap between synthetic and expected distributions to yield a value from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (complete overlap) as depicted in Eq. 5.
The Jaccard Index supports objectives 1 and 3 by enhancing the models' predictive accuracy for questions with binary response options and evaluating how finely tuned models can differentiate between various opinions.
Meta-Data
The section provides insights into how KL-divergence is used to measure the deviation of a synthetic distribution from expected ones for environmental questions in the context of the study. The formula 𝐽(𝐴, 𝐵) = |𝐴 ∩ 𝐵| |𝐴 ∪ 𝐵| is central to calculating the KL-divergence score.

KL-Divergence Measurement
The researchers use KL-divergence to quantify the extent to which the synthetic distribution differs from the expected distributions related to environmental queries. Key points include:

KL-Divergence Score Interpretation:

A KL-divergence score of 0 signifies a perfect match between the synthetic and expected distributions.
Increasing KL-divergence scores indicate growing discrepancies between distributions.
Effectiveness of KL-Divergence:

KL-divergence is a valuable tool for evaluating probabilistic alignment between distributions.
It helps ensure that the model can generalize effectively across various sociodemographic groups.
Assessment and Fine-Tuning:

KL-divergence quantifies discrepancies, aiding in the evaluation of limitations in fine-tuning processes.
It plays a crucial role in achieving the study's objective related to environmental questions.
Improvement through Fine-Tuning
Fine-tuning plays a crucial role in enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) specifically in the context of attitudes towards environmental issues. The paper demonstrates this improvement through a comparison of response distributions between pre-trained and fine-tuned LLMs across a set of ten questions.

Fine-tuning the LLMs resulted in a notable alignment between synthetic and expected response distributions.
Figures in the paper, such as Fig. X to Fig. A10, visually represent this alignment achieved through fine-tuning.
An example cited in the paper shows a substantial decrease in the overrepresentation of pro-environmental responses post fine-tuning, effectively bringing synthetic data closer to actual response distributions.
Comparison of Pre-Trained vs. Fine-Tuned Models
Pre-trained models excel at general NLP tasks but struggle with domain-specific opinions like those related to environmental policymaking scepticism due to socio-demographic influences.

Key Points:
Pre-trained models fail to capture the impact of socio-demographic factors on public opinions, leading to uniform responses regardless of individual characteristics.
Fine-tuning models can significantly enhance the diversity and accuracy of responses, especially in capturing how different demographic groups perceive environmental policies.
A fine-tuned model, when provided with specific demographic information, accurately predicts support for renewable energy and carbon tax policies, aligning with actual survey data.
Models without fine-tuning oversimplify responses, overlooking regional disparities in opinions on renewable energy and carbon taxes.
Comparison tables show more polarizing support for carbon taxes across income groups in fine-tuned models, indicating improved specificity compared to pre-trained models.
Model Comparison for Support and Opposition to Carbon Taxes
The study compares the performance of pre-trained and fine-tuned GPT-3.5 models in predicting support for carbon taxes among high-income individuals and opposition to carbon taxes among low-income individuals. Here's a brief overview:

Pre-trained GPT-3.5 Results:

Support for Carbon Taxes (High Income): 65%
Opposition to Carbon Taxes (Low Income): 35%
Confidence Interval: ±5%
Fine-tuned GPT-3.5 Results:

Support for Carbon Taxes (High Income): 82%
Opposition to Carbon Taxes (Low Income): 55%
Confidence Interval: ±2%
Key findings:

Fine-tuned GPT-3.5 shows higher accuracy in predicting both support and opposition to carbon taxes compared to the pre-trained model.
Support for carbon taxes is significantly higher among high-income individuals when predicted by the fine-tuned model.
Opposition to carbon taxes is notably lower among low-income individuals when assessed by the fine-tuned model.
Response Distributions Generated by Various Language Models
The researchers presented a table displaying synthetic response distributions to ten specific environmental questions. These responses were generated by different language models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, and GPT-4o1-preview, after fine-tuning. The table provides insights into how these models interpret and respond to environmental questions, offering a comparative analysis of their predictive capabilities.

Fine-tuned models had an average p-value of 0.3358, suggesting better mimicry of public sentiments compared to pre-trained models.
The Jaccard Index for fine-tuned models increased to 0.72, indicating improved accuracy in binary outputs, although marginal gains were seen for binary-response questions related to pollution.
Model Limitations and Recommendations:

Binary-response questions may benefit from additional contextual features like regional air quality indices to capture subtle variations effectively.
More synthetic examples incorporating detailed environmental metrics could help address class imbalances and improve the models' ability to predict public sentiment accurately.
Fine-Tuning as a Key Element in LLM Design
Fine-tuning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for improving domain-specific task performance in fields like environmental and climate sciences. The study highlights the following key points:

Performance Improvements: Fine-tuning significantly enhances model performance by reducing Chi-Square and KL-divergence scores, improving alignment with real-world data from UKHLS datasets.

Bias Mitigation: Fine-tuning addresses biases like overrepresentation of certain individuals, which were observed in pre-trained models.

Gradient Accumulation: To mitigate biases, gradient accumulation is used to process large datasets in smaller batches over multiple iterations, aiding in classifying views from minority groups.

Tailored Profiling Variables: Introducing tailored profiling variables, like job insecurity and spending habits, improves the identification of stakeholders' preferences in renewable energy spending decisions.

Ethical Concerns: The introduction of profiling variables raises ethical concerns about reinforcing stereotypes, emphasizing the importance of balancing model efficacy with fairness.

Broader Societal Implications: While fine-tuning offers technical benefits, researchers need to consider the broader societal and ethical implications of this approach to ensure fairness and mitigate biases.

Challenges in Fine-Tuning
Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) poses challenges related to dataset representation, biases, and model responsiveness to societal shifts:

Overfitting is a significant concern, particularly with smaller or domain-specific datasets like the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS).
The UKHLS dataset, spanning from January 2009 to May 2023, may not reflect recent developments, leading to biases and misguiding LLM fine-tuning.
To address these challenges:
Training datasets need to be representative and kept current to align with evolving societal views.
Mitigating sampling bias is crucial to ensure accurate conditioning datasets and to compare LLM-generated responses effectively.
Issues like missing or invalid profile parameters in the conditioning dataset, such as an inapplicable "highest qualification" variable, can affect national representativeness.
Discrepancies between the UKHLS data and external survey results (e.g., YouGov data) highlight the importance of accurate dataset representation.
Incorrect data distributions may lead to erroneous conclusions about synthetic data accuracy and unnecessary fine-tuning steps.
Misrepresenting proportions in the dataset, such as overrepresenting higher education qualifications, can skew model outcomes towards counterproductive actions, like undermining support for green policies.
Ethical Considerations
The ethical implications of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) are significant, mainly due to biases inherited from training data. Some key points include:

LLMs inherit biases, making it challenging to choose the ideal sample for training.
Surveys used for data collection face non-response issues, impacting the representativeness of the data.
To reduce bias, precise data processing methods like tailored questionnaires are necessary to capture stakeholder interests accurately.
Balancing accuracy and fairness in LLM applications raises concerns about their practicality in real-world scenarios, such as in environmental policymaking.
Systematic biases could lead to the marginalization of underrepresented communities.
Transparency in LLM operations is crucial, especially in how outputs are generated based on defined roles through profiling variables.
Transparent models help build trust with stakeholders by showing how their data is utilized. An example is using counterfactuals to understand varying perspectives, as demonstrated in contrasting opinions on climate change controllability.
Addressing these ethical and technical challenges highlights the importance of robust strategies for optimizing fine-tuning and guiding future research endeavors.
Evaluation Metrics and Their Limitations
The authors in this study employed various evaluation metrics to gauge the performance of the fine-tuned models, each shedding light on distinct aspects of model performance. However, it is crucial to recognize the constraints associated with each metric. Key points included in this section are:

Cosine Similarity:

Effective for comparing opinion directions but may overlook differences in response magnitudes, such as opinion intensity.
Most scores fall within a limited range (0.87-0.98), limiting their ability to distinguish between similar distributions.
Fine-tuned and pre-trained models achieved similar cosine similarity scores (0.91-0.98 and 0.87-0.93, respectively), potentially misrepresenting how models mirror public sentiment, particularly for polarizing environmental questions.
KL-Divergence:

Sensitive to minor differences in high-dimensional data, which may not always be meaningful, especially in sparse responses.
Both pre-trained and fine-tuned models achieved similar KL-divergence scores, reflecting similar trends in distributions from both datasets.
Chi-Square Tests and Jaccard Index:

Chi-Square tests are valuable for assessing alignment between synthetic and expected distributions but can be erroneous if the expected distributions are misrepresented.
The Jaccard Index, beneficial for binary responses, may not capture complex or nuanced opinions when dealing with numerous categories.
Despite improved distribution alignment from pre-trained to fine-tuned models, the Jaccard index did not significantly reflect this enhancement (Pre-trained score: 0.67 vs. Fine-tuned score: 0.74).
Overall Evaluation:

Utilizing multiple metrics addresses the limitations of each, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of how fine-tuned models can replicate opinions on environmental policies across diverse perspectives.
Multi-Task Learning for Optimized Fine-Tuning
This section highlights the efficacy of fine-tuning in enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating public opinions and underscores the potential of multi-task learning to optimize this process. Here are the key points included:

Multi-task learning enables LLMs to handle multiple tasks concurrently, reducing the risk of overfitting.
Transfer learning plays a crucial role in enabling LLMs to multi-task efficiently, particularly in scenarios with sparse or costly training data, like environmental policy simulations.
Pilaut et al. (2020) introduced a method for multi-task learning that improved performance by 2.2% on the GLUE benchmark compared to fully finetuned BERT models. This method also reduced data volume to 64.6% of its original size by balancing parameter weights.
Implementing similar techniques in training could lead to simultaneous processing of different profiling variables, potentially cutting computational overhead by at least 30% in environmental policy simulations.
Adaptive Fine-Tuning and Layer Optimization
Exploring adaptive fine-tuning methods like the LRBench framework can help determine optimal learning rates and training depths for different layers in Large Language Models (LLMs):

Unlike uniform fine-tuning, this approach optimizes each layer individually to maintain high-relevance layers' focus while retaining general knowledge.
Preliminary studies suggest adaptive fine-tuning could enhance task-specific performance by up to 15%.
In environmental applications, adaptive fine-tuning and layer optimization could:

Enhance LLMs' grasp of variables like public attitudes toward region-specific renewable energy policies.
Active Learning to Address Data Sparsity
Integrating active learning into Large Language Models (LLMs) allows them to request informative samples for learning during the fine-tuning process. The benefits of active learning in this context were demonstrated in image recognition tasks where it reduced the required labeled data by up to 40%, leading to improved classification accuracy.

Adapting active learning strategies to policy simulations could aid in addressing data sparsity issues related to underrepresented demographic groups, such as rural or lower-income populations. This adaptation can enhance the effectiveness of these models in handling diverse data representations.

Active learning offers the advantage of facilitating dynamic model updates, ensuring that LLMs can adjust to evolving public opinions. By doing so, biases in the models can be minimized over time, making them more reliable and inclusive in their decision-making processes.

Key points:

Active learning in LLMs reduces the need for labeled data and enhances classification accuracy.
Adapting active learning to policy simulations can benefit underrepresented demographic groups.
Dynamic model updates through active learning help align LLMs with evolving public opinions and reduce biases.
Summary of Findings
The study illustrates the significance of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for domain-specific tasks, specifically in shaping opinions to influence environmental policies. Key points included:

Models like GPT-4o, GPT-4omini, and GPT-4o1-preview, post fine-tuning, generated more realistic responses, aligning closely with real-world data distributions.
Evaluation metrics like Chi-Square tests, Cosine Similarity, KL-divergence scores, and Jaccard Indexes confirmed the improved performance of these fine-tuned models.
By considering socio-demographic factors such as regional, income, and educational variations, fine-tuned LLMs could better generalize and produce opinions supporting environmental policy changes.
Fine-tuning enhanced the distribution of responses and enabled the modeling of minority opinions, like preferences for eco-friendly products or willingness to engage with environmental organizations.
The results emphasize that fine-tuning is crucial for transforming LLMs from general-purpose tools into specialized systems capable of accurately simulating diverse public opinions.
