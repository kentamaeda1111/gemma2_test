Impact of Styles on LLM Fine-tuning
This section delves into the influence of styles on Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning, focusing on two key research questions:

Key Elements Influencing LLM Style-Fine-Tuning:
Investigates the crucial aspects of style that can affect LLM Stylistic Fine-Tuning (SFT).
Effect of Style Consistency and Data Quality on LLM Performance:
Examines how the consistency of style and the quality of data can impact the overall performance of LLMs.
RQ1: What Factors Constitute Response Style
The analysis revealed that response style comprises presentation and creativity styles, significantly impacting the LLM fine-tuning performance:

Presentation Style:
Refers to tone, word choice, and formatting of responses.
GPT-3.5 responses are typically formal, use bullet points, and transitional words, unless instructed otherwise.
Human responses vary in tone from formal to conversational and lack consistent formatting.
Creativity Style:
Involves content selection, strategies, and techniques in crafting responses, focusing on uncertainty or creativity relative to the instruction.
GPT-3.5 leans towards straightforward coding solutions with minimal external libraries.
Human responses offer diverse, novel solutions with complex syntax, niche packages, or external URLs, reflecting individual expertise and perspectives.
These styles are crucial in understanding response differences between AI-generated and human-generated data and play a significant role in fine-tuning LLMs.

RQ2: Influence of Style Consistency and Data Quality on LLM Performance
The researchers conducted experiments to investigate how style consistency and data quality impact the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). Here are the key points from this section:

Experimental Setup:

Three dataset types were created: human-generated, referenced, and direct, to analyze the influence of presentation and creativity styles on LLM performance.
Human responses were obtained from StackExchange for coding and LIMA dataset for the general domain.
Synthetic responses with controlled styles ("referenced" and "direct") were generated by chat-LLMs to isolate the effects of data quality on LLM performance.
Various LLM models were used, including GPT-3.5turbo, Llama-2-70b-chat-hf, and Llama-2-13b-chat-hf.
Stylometric Analysis:

Five metrics were employed to evaluate stylistic elements of human and synthetic responses, including Type Token Ratio (TTR), Flesch score, and perplexity to quantify response creativity.
T-SNE plots illustrated that synthetic responses were more consistent in presentation styles compared to human responses.
Data Quality Analysis:

Responses generated by more advanced LLM models matched or surpassed the quality of human-written responses in both coding and general domains.
Lower-quality data correlated with poorer LLM performance, emphasizing the importance of data quality in LLM fine-tuning.
Impact on LLM Performance:

LLM performance was influenced by both data quality and style consistency in responses.
"Direct" responses consistently improved LLM performance more than "referenced" responses when data quality was comparable.
Higher style consistency in presentation and creativity styles led to significantly better LLM performance.
Insights:

Response style comprises presentation style and creativity style, with LLM-generated responses exhibiting higher style consistency than human responses.
Enhanced data quality and style consistency in datasets contribute to improved LLM fine-tuning, highlighting the importance of both factors in optimizing LLM performance.
Style Consistency-Aware Ranking
The researchers introduce SCAR, a ranker designed to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by capturing differences in presentation and creativity styles. Here are the key points included:

SCAR aims to learn a ranking function R(x, y) to identify responses aligning consistently with a helpful answering style.
The objective is to learn the ranking function based on desired pairwise orderings from the findings, indicating the consistency in creativity and presentation styles.
A margin α is used to ensure differences in ranking scores, and a quality measure function f (x, y) assesses the response's quality given an instruction.
Quality assessment using strong LLMs like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 helps evaluate the helpfulness and correctness of responses.
The reward function Rθ(x, y) is modeled as a neural network that considers presentation style v_p and creativity style v_c. Some key points from this section are:

Style representations are learned from sequences using an encoder like RoBERTa-base for open-ended domain or codet5p-110membedding for the code domain.
The representations for presentation and creativity styles are obtained by processing response sequences to capture relevant features.
To ensure distinct style representations and guide the learning process, triplet margin losses are incorporated. Additionally:

After training the reward function, instruction-response pairs are ranked, and a style-consistent subset is selected for fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs.
Filtering the dataset to include the top k% of examples with high scores enhances the performance of LLMs on target tasks more effectively than using the entire original dataset.
Experiments
The experiments involve training SCAR on data from coding and open-ended question-answering domains to select examples for LLM SFT from the same domains. Here are the key points included:

Ranker Data Collection:

Instructions for SCAR training and evaluation are gathered.
Data includes 10,000 examples from StackExchange for the code domain and 6,000 instructions from a combination of Dolly data samples and the LIMA dataset.
Data Creation:

Instructions are paired with human responses and responses generated by GPT-3.5-turbo.
Responses are rated by GPT-3.5-turbo according to specified constraints.
Ranker Allocation:

Data is split into an 8:1:1 ratio for training, validation, and testing of the ranker.
Ranker Evaluation:

Accuracy of the ranker in rating responses is reported on the test dataset.
LLM SFT Data Selection:

SCAR and baselines select data from two diverse but style-inconsistent sources: Human-Crowdsourced Data and Mixed Synthetic Data.
Diverse Data Sources:

Human-generated data for the code domain is from StackExchange with high-quality instructions and responses.
Mixed synthetic data includes examples from various sources like StackExchange, Evol-Instruct, and Self-Instruct for language diversity.
LLM Evaluation:

Evaluation methods like HumanEval and AlpacaEval are used for coding evaluation and general tasks, respectively.
LLMs are fine-tuned using LoRA with specified data selection methods.
Different Training Approaches:

SCAR can be trained on in-domain (ID) data and select examples within the same domain or on out-of-domain (OOD) datasets.
Main Results and Discussion
The effectiveness of SCAR(ID)-selected data in accelerating Sequential Fine-Tuning (SFT) while reducing costs is highlighted. Key points include:

Models fine-tuned on only 25% and 10% of SCAR(ID)-selected data outperform those trained on full datasets in coding and general domains.
SCAR(ID)-selected data consistently outperforms other baselines in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs).
The impact of selected data sizes on LLM performance and the effectiveness of various methods are discussed, revealing:

Using fewer data generally lowers LLM performance in the coding domain, but in the open-ended domain, most methods selecting fewer synthetic data result in better LLM performance.
SCAR(ID) consistently improves LLM performance in the open domain, indicating that vast amounts of data may not always be necessary for optimal performance.
The impact of SCAR performance on style consistency in selected data is analyzed, indicating:

Enhanced style consistency in selected data, leading to lower perplexity and Text-To-Token Ratio (TTR) standard deviation in the Dolly dataset.
Challenges in differentiating creativity styles within code data, as evidenced by increased perplexity standard deviation when selecting smaller subsets of code data, potentially affecting LLM fine-tuning performance.
Overall, SCAR(ID) proves superior in enhancing style consistency and supporting LLM performance, primarily through improved style consistency rather than average data quality enhancements.

Ablation Study
The researchers conducted an ablation study to assess the effectiveness of SCAR(ID) components by comparing different settings using GPT-3.5:

Compared the full setting (Full, GPT-3.5) to versions without the quality constraint, without representation learning, and without certain elements.
Distance patterns between presentation and creativity embeddings align with the optimization objective even without the loss, possibly due to the "referenced" responses used in training.
A low coefficient (0.1) for the representation learning loss was utilized.
Removing the data quality constraint notably reduces the performance of LLMs, especially when trained on lower-quality data like Llama2-13b-generated responses.
Emphasized the significance of the constraint when training the ranker on lower-quality data.
Using synthetic data from other LLMs for SCAR training slightly impairs the performance of fine-tuned LLMs, particularly with Llama2-13b-generated data due to quality constraint filtering.
Performance comparison was done with open-source LLMs (e.g., OLMO-7b and Starcoder-15.5b) fine-tuned with subsets of their original datasets selected via SCAR(ID).
Evaluation metrics like Pass@(1+10) for Starcoder were compared for different data subset sizes against the original dataset sizes.

Conclusion
The researchers found that training datasets with higher consistency in presentation and creativity improve the performance of fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs). To measure stylistic consistency in training data, they introduced SCAR, a ranker specifically designed for this purpose.

Key points included:

LLMs fine-tuned with even small subsets of the original dataset, selected using SCAR, outperformed those trained on full datasets.
SCAR consistently outperformed other data selection baselines in training LLMs.
The study emphasizes the importance of consistency and creativity in training datasets for enhancing LLM performance.
Limitations
The limitations of the study center around potential challenges that arise when training a Large Language Model (LLM) on heavily biased data towards a specific style, as illustrated by the data selected by SCAR. Some key limitations include:

While training an LLM on style-biased data may enhance its capabilities for various tasks, it can lead to output style skew towards that particular style, akin to GPT-3.5-turbo.
This bias towards a specific style could restrict the adaptability of the fine-tuned LLM in scenarios requiring diverse stylistic outputs, like multi-agent role-playing LLMs or content generation with varying tones and styles.
The fine-tuned model may struggle to generate outputs deviating from the trained style, potentially limiting its flexibility and usability across different applications.

A.11 Ablation Study
Tables 13 and 14 in the paper illustrate the impact of removing various components from SCAR on the performance of LLMs. Here are the key points from the ablation study:

Removing most ablated components from SCAR, whether from human or synthetic data sources in the code domain, leads to a significant decrease in performance, highlighting the importance of each component in the methodology.
Surprisingly, removing representation learning (w/o RL, GPT-3.5) and "referenced" responses (w/o ref, GPT-3.5) did not result in as much performance decline in the code domain as expected. However, there was still a noticeable reduction in performance.
The findings from the ablation study confirmed the effectiveness of the individual components in SCAR.
Following these results, the researchers conducted two additional analyses, which are detailed further in the paper.

A.12 Impact of Training SCAR Without Referenced Responses
Training SCAR without referenced responses leads to a notable decrease in performance in the open domain, emphasizing the significance of utilizing referenced responses for learning representations in creative styles. Conversely, in the code domain, the impact of lacking referenced responses on performance is only marginal.

Key Points:

Performance significantly drops in the open domain when SCAR is trained without referenced responses.
Emphasizes the importance of referenced responses for learning representations in creative styles.
In the code domain, the absence of referenced responses has a minimal effect on performance.
A.13 Representation Distances/Similarities Analysis
The section conducts an analysis of representation distances and similarities by calculating cosine similarities between creativity and presentation style embeddings for different pairs. Specifically, the following pairs are considered:

("direct"-"referenced"): cos(v_d, v_r)
("referenced"-"human"): cos(v_r, v_h)
("direct"-"human"): cos(v_d, v_h)
The analysis expects the distance between ("direct"-"referenced") to be smaller than the distances for ("referenced"-"human") and ("direct"-"human") concerning presentation style embeddings. Conversely, the distance for ("referenced"-"human") is anticipated to be the smallest in terms of these representations.
