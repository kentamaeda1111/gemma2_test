Giorgio Roffo










This document is a tutorial exploring advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and the techniques used to improve their capabilities and address limitations. It provides a comprehensive overview, going beyond a simple explanation of LLMs to delve into the sophisticated architectures and frameworks that power state-of-the-art AI systems.

Here's a breakdown of the key sections:

1. Introduction:

The Problem: The tutorial highlights the inherent limitations of LLMs, such as:

Temporal knowledge cutoffs: LLMs have a limited knowledge base, cut off at a specific point in time.

Mathematical inaccuracies: They struggle with complex calculations.

Hallucinations: They can generate plausible but factually incorrect information.

Solutions: It introduces various techniques and frameworks designed to mitigate these limitations:

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Connects LLMs to external knowledge bases for up-to-date information.

Program-Aided Language Models (PAL): Integrates LLMs with code interpreters for complex computations.

Chain-of-Thought Prompting: Encourages step-by-step reasoning in the LLM.

ReAct Framework: Combines reasoning with actions, allowing LLMs to interact with the external world.

LangChain: A modular framework that simplifies the integration of LLMs into applications.

2. Beyond Basic LLMs:

This section emphasizes that advanced AI systems are not just LLMs but a combination of LLMs with other components and frameworks working together. It details the roles of:

LLMs: The core engine for text generation.

RAG: Accessing external data sources for up-to-date information.

Chain-of-Thought Prompting: Improving reasoning capabilities.

PAL: Handling complex calculations using code interpreters.

ReAct: Integrating reasoning with actions to interact with external tools and environments.

LangChain: Simplifying the development of complex LLM-based applications.

3. Survey of Transformer Architectures in Language Models:

This section provides a technical overview of the transformer architecture, explaining its key components:

Self-Attention Mechanism: Allows the model to consider the relationships between all words in a sentence, not just adjacent ones.

Encoder-Decoder Structure: Describes the structure found in many LLMs.

Encoder-Only Models (like BERT): Suitable for tasks requiring deep understanding of the input text.

Encoder-Decoder Models (like BART, T5): For sequence-to-sequence tasks such as translation.

Decoder-Only Models (like GPT family): Excel at text generation.

4. LLM Training Resources: GPU Memory Requirements:

The tutorial discusses the challenges of training large LLMs, which often require vast computational resources, and introduces methods for efficient training across multiple GPUs:

Distributed Data Parallel (DDP): Replicates the entire model on each GPU.

Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP): Shards the model's parameters and optimizer states across multiple GPUs.

ZeRO Optimization: A strategy that reduces memory usage during training by sharding different components of the model across GPUs.

1-bit LLMs: A recent advancement that uses 1-bit precision for model weights, resulting in significant memory savings.

5. Fine-Tuning Strategies:

This section covers different methods for adapting pre-trained LLMs to specific tasks:

Instruction Fine-tuning: Using datasets with instructions and desired outputs.

Multitask Fine-tuning: Training on multiple tasks simultaneously to improve generalization.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT): Updating only a subset of the model's parameters.

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA): Injects low-rank matrices to approximate the original weights.

Prompt Tuning: Adding trainable tokens (soft prompts) to the input.

6. Comparison of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforced Self-Training (ReST):

This section compares two techniques for aligning LLMs with human preferences:

RLHF: Uses human feedback to iteratively fine-tune the model.

ReST: A more efficient approach that uses a two-loop system (Grow and Improve) to reduce computational cost.

7. Conclusion:

The tutorial concludes by summarizing the key concepts, highlighting the advancements in LLM technology and emphasizing the importance of integrating LLMs with external knowledge sources and utilizing efficient fine-tuning strategies for a variety of applications.

In essence, this is a high-level yet detailed resource providing a solid understanding of the complexities of modern LLMs and the various methods employed to improve their capabilities and address their limitations.
