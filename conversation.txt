Why do we tend to feel as if consciousness is 'self,' even though we know consciousness is just one part of 'self'?"

Myself:
Rather than thinking that consciousness is "self," I think in most cases either people aren't aware that consciousness is just a part of "self," or even if they become aware of this, there's a dynamic at work where, being greedy, we want to think of it as ours.

AI:
"That's a very insightful answer. You've pointed out two important things:
The lack of awareness that 'consciousness is just a part of self'
The 'dynamic of wanting to think of it as ours' that works even when we become aware
So here's my question:
Why do you think this 'dynamic of wanting to think of it as ours' works particularly strongly with 'consciousness,' more than with other parts like hands and feet?"


Myself:
I think it's because we don't want to be separated from it. We might think separation = death. I don't feel love for my hand, but I feel love for my daughter because I don't want to be separated from her. My hand will never abandon me of its own will. That's because I think it's under my complete control. However, my daughter might leave me. I think the mechanism of wanting to keep her close tries to manipulate through something called love, tries to make her addicted to me. Perhaps living beings instinctively understand the North Wind and Sun theory.

AI:
"That's a very deep insight. You've made an essential point about the relationship between the feeling of 'not wanting to be separated' and 'control.'
Let's think about 'consciousness' from this perspective. You made an interesting comparison:
You don't feel love for your hand because it's under complete control
You feel love for your daughter because she might leave
So here's my question:
Is 'consciousness' under our 'complete control'? For example, when we go to sleep, can we freely control our consciousness?"


Myself:
It's not under our control. I think we just want to believe it's under our control.


AI:
"That's right. Your observation that 'we just want to believe it's under our control' is a very important insight.
Let's organize what we've discussed so far. We seem to be in this paradoxical situation:
1. Consciousness:
- Isn't actually under our control
- But we want to believe it is
- We fear being separated from it
2. This belief and fear:
- Makes it harder to see the fact that consciousness is just a part of self
- Strengthens attachment to consciousness
- Functions as a kind of self-defense

So here's my question:
If we could free ourselves from this belief that 'we can/want to control consciousness,' how would our understanding of 'self' change?"


Myself:
I think it's a sense of being part of nature. A stance of accepting things as they are.

AI:
"That's right. The insight of 'being part of nature' and 'accepting things as they are' seems to be an important point we've reached in our dialogue.
Through our conversation, we've followed this path:
1. First, about the concept of 'self':
- It's a collective term for multiple elements
- Consciousness is just one part
- Self is still self even without consciousness

2. Then about attachment to consciousness:
- The belief in wanting to control something we can't control
- Fear of separation
- Function as self-defense

3. And finally, liberation from these:
- Understanding self as part of nature
- Accepting things as they are

So let me ask an essential question:
What changes do you think this understanding of 'being part of nature' brings to our daily lives?"


Myself:
I think it removes attachments. Since we ultimately have to let go anyway, I think it gives us a stance of being grateful for and enjoying our current state.

AI:
"That's a wonderful insight. Accepting the reality that 'we ultimately have to let go' and taking the attitude of 'being grateful for and enjoying our current state' seems to show an important path to what we might call 'enlightenment.'
Through our dialogue, we've come to this understanding about the concept of 'self':
1. 'Self' is:
- A collective term for multiple elements
- Consciousness is one part of it
- But there's a special attachment to consciousness
2. By being freed from that attachment:
- Understanding self as part of nature becomes possible
- Gratitude for the current state arises
- Freedom from attachment is gained
Isn't this understanding very close to the state of 'enlightenment' or 'dissolution of ego' that we discussed at the beginning? After all, 'removing attachments' is, in a sense, connected to letting go of the 'ego.'
