# Design Decisions for Japanese-Speaking Socratic Gemma

## Document Purpose
This document outlines the key design decisions and rationale behind the Japanese-Speaking Socratic Gemma project, a Kaggle competition submission that fine-tunes Gemma-2b for Socratic-style dialogue generation in Japanese. While the technical implementation details can be found in the code, this document focuses on the philosophical and empirical foundations that guided our approach.

## Fundamental Premise: The Primacy of Data Quality
Our core thesis is that the quality of training data is more crucial than model architecture or hyperparameter tuning for achieving desired language model behavior. This "data-centric" approach is particularly relevant when attempting to instill specific conversational styles or patterns in smaller language models.

Recent research strongly supports this approach. Liu et al. (2023) demonstrated that parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA can effectively capture individual writing styles, achieving up to 85% style transfer accuracy with high-quality, consistent training data. This finding directly influenced our decision to use LoRA for fine-tuning Gemma-2b, as it allows us to efficiently capture Socratic dialogue patterns while working within computational constraints.

Additionally, Li et al.'s (2023) work with SCAR (Style Consistency-Aware Response Ranking) showed that models trained on smaller, carefully curated datasets consistently outperformed those trained on larger, less focused datasets. In their experiments, models trained on just 30% of highly style-consistent data outperformed those trained on complete datasets. This research validated our decision to prioritize data quality over quantity when building our Japanese Socratic dialogue dataset.

These findings are particularly relevant to our project for several practical reasons:
- We're working with a relatively small model (Gemma-2b)
- We're targeting a specific stylistic goal (Socratic dialogue patterns)
- We're operating under computational constraints

This data-centric philosophy informed all subsequent design decisions, from dataset composition to evaluation metrics and hyperparameter optimization. The following sections detail how this fundamental premise influenced specific aspects of our implementation...
